## Simple-DLL-Injector

Basic Dynamic Link Library(DLL) injector for **WINDOWS**. In the tutorial they hardcode DLL path and process name into the code, I used console arguments to avoid recompiling the code for each game/app i am injecting DLLs into.

## Usage
```
./app_name path_to_dll process_name
```
